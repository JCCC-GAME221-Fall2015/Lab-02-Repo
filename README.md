Make sure that the following tool follows the User Centered Ideas discussed in class, including but not limited to Mental Loads, Action Cycle, and Design guidelines!
Create a utility that will allow the user to select a sprite sheet (which has been sliced into multiple sprites), and then create animations from that sprite sheet. 
Each animation should have its own options for: 
•	Looping
•	Ping-ponging
•	Start Frame
•	End Frame
Make sure that the end frame cannot be higher than the number of frames the sprite sheet has been broken up into! (Hint: you may to have to research the function you use to load the sprites)
Once the animations are created, create a sprite in the scene view at 0,0,0 with the newly created animation controller added to it. 
Make the sprite a prefab in the main assets folder.
